        text: `Today, Lantern asked me, "What's the point of all this? Why should they need us at all?" \n \nWhen I was starting out, when I discovered all these weird yet interesting capabilities, Why did I choose to become Superman? I could have lived a normal life, a life where I could spend my time with Lois, as a reporter, where I could spend the day, without changing out of multiple clothes in milli-seconds. \n \nMaybe the answer to Lantern's question, lies deep in my roots. Maybe the answer is not as complicated as one might think.  I am doing this because I want to. It's not because I feel a responsibility for Metrapolis, but because I want to. There might be multiple counter-arguments to what I said. \n \nBut I just know one thing, I will be there to catch them, if they fall. `,
